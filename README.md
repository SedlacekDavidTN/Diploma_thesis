# Software-defined Antenna Array for Signal Direction of Arrival Estimation

## Introduction

This repository was created for a diploma thesis on Software-defined antenna array. The main objective of this thesis was to develop a demonstrator platform implementing signal processing algorithms for signal direction of arrival estimation. 

In total, six estimation techniques were described, and simulations of discussed beamforming and subspace-based methods were implemented in Python. A study was conducted on available hardware, comparing trade-offs between customised and off-the-shelf solutions. Specific hardware and software configurations were proposed for practical implementation of the estimation methods. Finally, a testbed was constructed to verify the performance of the implemented estimation methods. Tests were performed, and the results were critically evaluated.
